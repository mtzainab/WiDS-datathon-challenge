# WiDS-datathon-challenge #2
 **Women in Data Science (WiDS)** Worldwide is on a mission to increase participation of women in data science to benefit societies worldwide.

Healthcare inequity is a global challenge. Addressing this challenge has an extensive positive impact on women’s health, which is key for societies and economies to thrive. This datathon is designed to help you discover whether disparate treatments exist and to understand the drivers of those biases, such as demographic and societal factors.
 
 **Overview: The Dataset and Challenge**
Gilead Sciences is the sponsor for this year’s WiDS Datathon. They provided a rich, real-world dataset which contains information about demographics, diagnosis and treatment options, and insurance provided about patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer. The dataset originated from Health Verity, one of the largest healthcare data ecosystems in the US. It was enriched with third party geo-demographic data to provide views into the socio economic aspects that may contribute to health equity. For this challenge, the dataset was then further enriched with zip code level climate data.

**Challenge task:** You will be asked to predict the duration of time it takes for patients to receive metastatic cancer diagnosis.

The primary goal of building these models is to detect relationships between demographics of the patient with the likelihood of getting timely treatment. The secondary goal is to see if climate patterns impact proper diagnosis and treatment.Gilead Sciences, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company that specializes in the research, development, and commercialization of medicines, primarily in the fields of virology, infectious diseases, oncology, and other areas of unmet medical need.

Evaluation Submissions for the leaderboard will be evaluated on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The RMSE is a commonly used measure of the differences between predicted values provided by a model and the actual observed values. Learn more about RMSE in this Kaggle Learn Forum post.
